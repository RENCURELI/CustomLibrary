# CustomLibrary
Creating a Data Structure and Algorithm library

Done :
  - Forward List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Array
  - Vector
  - Stack
  - Deque

In Progress :
  - Queue
  - Priority Queue

TODO Data Structures :
  - Allocators ( yes, I'm starting to get sidetracked, but I'm curious )
    - If Allocators are done -> Vector - Emplace
  - Set
  - Map
  - Tuple
  - Graphs ( Binary tree, Heap, etc... )

TODO Algorithms :
  - Find
  - Sort
  - Dijkstra
  - A*
  - To Be Determined ( Not sure what algorithms could be useful )
  
TODO Maths :
  - Vector ( 2, 3 and 4 )
  - Matrices
  - Euler Angles
  - Quaternions
  - To Be Determined ( not really sure what is needed for a good math library )
